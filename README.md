# automation-practice

## Purpose
This repo was made to practice https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/

## Tools
Jest for Test automation configuration and assertion library https://jestjs.io/
Selenium Webdriver Javascript for Automation functionality

# Test Documentation
As QA writing these, we will be writing this as though there is a hypothetical business document.  

## File Structure
File Structure is borrowed from [Automation Testing with Selenium JavaScript](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/automation-testing-with-selenium-javascript/)
- tests
-   tests will be handled with a module by file
- resources
- util
- data

## Goals
- Abstract away implementation so that when a tool changes, the base logic doesn't need to change.  
- Create a readable framework of tests.
